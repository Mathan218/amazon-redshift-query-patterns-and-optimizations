# amazon-redshift-query-patterns-and-optimizations
In this workshop you will launch an Amazon Redshift cluster in your AWS account and load sample data ~ 100GB using TPCH dataset. You will learn query patterns that affects Redshift performance and how to optimize them. In this lab we will also provide a framework to simulate workload management (WLM) queue and run concurrent queries in regular interval and measure performance metrics- query throughput, query duration etc. We will also provide some use cases for Redshift spectrum to query data from s3 in columnar format such as Parquet.
