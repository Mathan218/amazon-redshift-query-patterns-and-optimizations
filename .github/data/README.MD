The dataset used for this lab is generated using TPC-H tool (http://www.tpc.org/tpch/default.asp). I have used the data generation tool "dbgen" specified in http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.3.pdf. This creates the "order" dataset- orders and lineitems table of data size ~ 100 GB in delimited text format. I have further split the generated files into multiple parts, gzipped the multi-part files and uploaded into an s3 bucket.
